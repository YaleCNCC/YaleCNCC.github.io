# YCNCC Technical Documentation
This repository contains technical documentation for the [Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture (YCNCC)](https://naturalcarboncapture.yale.edu/).

## Development
The documentation is created using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which recommends using pip for intallation as well as using a [virual environment](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#using-pip-in-a-python-virtual-environment).

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv/
```

Activate the environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
